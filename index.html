PLAY, don't run DEAD
</br>
dead don't RUN 
</br>
dead PLAY
</br>

RUN, don't play dead
</br>

replayed plea
 IT'S begging for life
</br>
	in circular motion
</br>
pleading for help
 &
pleading his case </br>
	BUT begging for life </br>


It's as much to discover </br>

you're not playing</br>

and you're dead
	to DISCOVER</br>

you're under COVER</br>

Can't you see it's PLEADING?</br>

Running without shoes it's not so easy and we're not so tall</br>
i'll love you all.</br>
Only,</br>
 
	barefoot and DEAD</br>
